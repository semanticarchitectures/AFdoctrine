# **Accelerating Airpower: A Strategic Plan for the Enterprise-Wide Acquisition of Intelligent Capabilities**

## **Executive Summary**

**The Strategic Challenge:** The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is at a doctrinal and technological inflection point. The strategic environment, defined by near-peer competitors who are weaponizing automation at scale , has rendered the DAF's traditional, hardware-centric acquisition and operational models insufficient for the speed of modern warfare. Adversary advancements in integrated air defense systems (IADS), hypersonics, and electronic warfare threaten to overwhelm human decision-making and cede the competitive advantage.  
**The Objective:** This plan provides a 5-year strategy to accelerate the enterprise-wide acquisition and integration of *intelligent capabilities*. These are defined not just as discrete Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, but as the synergistic, force-multiplying fusion of autonomy, data-driven decision support, and advanced Human-Machine Teaming (HMT). The singular goal is to enhance mission success by achieving and maintaining "decision superiority" in a high-tempo, data-driven battlespace.  
**The Core Problem:** The DAF's challenge is not a deficit of innovation; it is a systemic failure of innovation adoption. Pockets of excellence, such as Kessel Run and projects from the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), have proven the value of modern software practices. However, these successes remain isolated, unable to scale beyond their programmatic boundaries. They are consistently trapped in the bureaucratic and funding "Valley of Death" and are further inhibited by deep-seated cultural, workforce, and data-readiness barriers.  
**The Solution: A New Acquisition Operating System (AOS):** To break this paradigm, this plan recommends a fundamental shift from ad-hoc reforms to an enterprise-wide "Acquisition Operating System" (AOS). This AOS is founded on four interdependent pillars:

1. **Institutionalizing Rapid, Tailored Acquisition Pathways:** Mandating the Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) and Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) as the default for intelligent systems.  
2. **Mandating an Open, Agile, & Secure Technical Baseline:** Enforcing a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and DevSecOps as the non-negotiable technical foundation for all new programs.  
3. **Forging a "Trilingual" Digital-Native Workforce:** Aggressively recruiting, developing, and retaining personnel fluent in operations, technology, and acquisition.  
4. **Building Warfighter Trust via Enterprise-Wide Responsible AI (RAI):** Integrating the DoD's ethical AI principles into the entire acquisition lifecycle to ensure capabilities are reliable, traceable, and governable.

**The 7-Year Technical Vision:** The long-term strategy (Years 5-7) focuses on building the resilient, secure, and distributed digital backbone required to support this new operating system. This plan details a technical roadmap for integrating:

1. **Future Compute:** A hybrid architecture that moves from centralized cloud for AI training to ruggedized, "at-the-edge" compute for operational inference.  
2. **Future Communications:** 5G and Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) as the low-latency, high-bandwidth connective tissue for Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2).  
3. **Future Trust:** Blockchain technology as the immutable "trust layer" for securing the software supply chain and guaranteeing data integrity in contested environments.

**The End State:** The successful execution of this plan will result in a DAF that has harnessed intelligent capabilities to achieve true decision superiority. It will enable the DAF to dominate the high-tempo, data-driven battlespace and successfully execute its core Operational Imperatives against any peer adversary, securing U.S. air and space power for the next generation.

## **Part I: The Strategic Imperative for Intelligent Airpower**

### **1.1 The New Character of War: From Industrial to Intelligent**

The foundational character of airpower is being redefined by the proliferation of intelligent technologies. The 20th-century paradigm, characterized by exquisite manned platforms and a relatively static industrial-age operational tempo, is being rendered obsolete. The emerging battlespace is one defined by algorithm-driven "machine-speed kill webs" , pervasive sensors, and autonomous systems operating at a scale and speed that overwhelm human cognition. This shift moves the central locus of conflict from a contest of platforms to a contest of algorithms, data processing, and decision-making speed.  
This transformation is not a choice; it is an imperative driven by the threat environment. Near-peer competitors, particularly China and Russia, are "investing heavily" in AI and AI-enabled capabilities. China's strategy of "military-civil fusion" provides a state-directed, centralized, and rapid pipeline for harnessing commercial innovation, directly challenging the U.S. military's slower, more bureaucratic acquisition models. This investment is not theoretical; it is manifested in fielded capabilities. The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), for example, has deployed over 1,300 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) and new hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) like the DF-17 and DF-27. These systems are designed to saturate defenses, hold U.S. and allied bases at risk within the second island chain , and create an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environment that undermines U.S. operational flexibility and air superiority.  
The DAF's ability to deter and, if necessary, defeat such an adversary is now contingent on its ability to develop and deploy software at the speed of relevance. The risk of ceding this competitive advantage is not a future-tense problem; it is an active, present-day challenge. The DAF must master the implications of this new, high-tempo, data-driven battlespace, or it risks being "outpaced" by adversaries who weaponize automation at scale.

### **1.2 The DAF's Doctrinal and Strategic Foundation for AI**

The Department of the Air Force possesses the intellectual and doctrinal foundation for this transformation, even as its execution remains fragmented. The service is not starting from a blank slate; it is guided by a practical, non-hyperbolic, and operationally-grounded view of AI.  
The cornerstone of this foundation is Air Force Doctrine Note (AFDN) 25-1, *Artificial Intelligence*. This document provides timely and authoritative guidance for Airmen, moving AI from a "buzzword" to a tangible enabler of core missions. Critically, AFDN 25-1 exhibits a pragmatic maturity by distinguishing between practical, narrow AI applications and the non-existent, strategically irrelevant "threat" of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The doctrine explicitly states that "AGI does not currently exist" and is "not ready for airpower employment". This pragmatism is a significant strategic advantage, focusing DAF efforts on what is achievable and operationally relevant.  
Instead of pursuing AGI, the doctrine directs Airmen to focus on integrating AI-enabled tools into core Air Force functions: Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Command and Control (C2); logistics; and planning. The central concept is Human-Machine Teaming (HMT), which AFDN 25-1 states "must capitalize on the best of human intuition and reasoning, combined with AI's extremely fast data processing capability". This grounded approach, which views AI as a tool for "offloading onerous, low-complexity tasks from humans to machines" , allows the DAF to field achievable, high-impact capabilities *now*—such as predictive maintenance, C2 decision aids, and autonomous wingmen—rather than being distracted by the "monolithic unicorn" of a hypothetical superintelligence.  
This doctrine is operationalized by the *DAF AI Advantage Strategy*. This strategy translates the "how" of AFDN 25-1 into the "what," prescribing an agile approach to development and adoption that targets five specific "decision advantage" outcomes :

1. Superior battlespace awareness and understanding.  
2. Adaptive force planning and application.  
3. Fast, precise, and resilient kill chains.  
4. Resilient sustainment support.  
5. Efficient enterprise business operations.

Underpinning this entire framework is a non-negotiable commitment to Responsible AI (RAI). Both DAF and DoD policy mandate that all AI capabilities must be Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable, and Governable. This is not merely an ethical constraint but a core component of mission success and a key asymmetric advantage. Adversaries are not beholden to the same ethical guidelines , which may allow them to field certain systems faster. However, the DAF's ability to design, develop, test, and deploy *trusted* and *governable* AI systems is the only viable path to building the non-technical, human "Warfighter Trust" required for operators to employ these systems under the immense pressure of combat.

### **1.3 The Operational Imperatives as the Primary "Demand Signal"**

The DAF's strategic and doctrinal foundations are given concrete form by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall's Seven Operational Imperatives. These imperatives are not an abstract wishlist; they are the DAF's specific, prioritized CONOPS for a peer-adversary conflict. They represent the most urgent capability gaps that must be filled, and intelligent capabilities are the *primary enabling technology* for their execution. The acceleration of AI is, therefore, not an independent science and technology effort; it is the *only* way to execute the DAF's chosen warfighting concept at a tempo that can win.  
The link between AI and the imperatives is direct and explicit:

* **Imperative 2: Achieving Operationally Optimized Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) / AF JADC2:** ABMS is the DAF's "system of systems" for JADC2. AI and machine learning are the *core* of this concept, serving as the "brain" required for the data fusion, real-time C2 decision support, and "machine-enabled insights" that allow commanders to operate inside an adversary's OODA loop.  
* **Imperative 3: Defining the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) System-of-Systems:** This imperative is explicitly defined as a "family-of-systems". It is not just a crewed fighter; it is a "crewed platform teamed with much less expensive autonomous un-crewed combat aircraft". These Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) are, by definition, an autonomous, AI-enabled system designed for HMT.  
* **Imperative 4: Achieving Moving Target Engagement at Scale in a Challenging Operational Environment:** The ability to find, fix, track, and engage a high volume of moving targets (e.g., PLARF launchers ) in a contested A2/AD environment is computationally impossible for unassisted human operators. This mission *requires* AI-enabled ISR fusion, autonomous "pop-up threat detection" , persistent autonomous ISR platforms , and automated targeting solutions.  
* **Imperative 5: Defining optimized resilient basing, sustainment, and communications in a contested environment:** This imperative addresses the need to survive and operate in an A2/AD environment, such as through Agile Combat Employment (ACE). AI is the critical enabler for this concept, powering the predictive asset maintenance (PANDA) , agile logistics planning , and supply chain optimization needed to sustain a distributed, resilient force.

The Operational Imperatives, therefore, are the DAF's answer to the adversary missile threats and A2/AD strategies detailed in and. This plan to accelerate intelligent capabilities is the *only* mechanism to provide the *means* to execute that answer.

## **Part II: Analysis of Keystone Intelligent Capability Programs & CONOPS**

### **2.1 Decision Superiority: Joint All-Domain Command & Control (JADC2) and ABMS**

The DAF's primary effort to acquire intelligent C2 capabilities is the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). ABMS is the DAF's material and technical contribution to the broader, DoD-wide *concept* of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2). JADC2 is not a single procurement program but a "series of interconnected capabilities" —an "internet of things" for the military —designed to connect sensors, decision-makers, and shooters across all warfighting domains (air, land, sea, space, and cyber).  
The explicit role of AI and machine learning is to function as the "brain" of this "system of systems". ABMS is designed to "collect and make sense of vast amounts of data supported by artificial intelligence". This AI-driven fusion is intended to move the DAF from a human-centric C2 process to one of "machine-enabled insights". By using AI to "simultaneously receive, fuse and act upon a vast array of data" , the JADC2 construct aims to provide "decision superiority"—the ability to sense, make sense, and act faster and more effectively than an adversary, thereby compressing the OODA loop to a "machine-speed" tempo.  
This technological vision, however, creates a direct and unresolved conflict with the DAF's established command culture. The *technical* architecture of ABMS is designed to function in a "contested and degraded electromagnetic spectrum". Survival and effectiveness in such an environment *require* a C2 philosophy of "distributed control, decentralized execution, \[and\] delegated authority". This "purple," or joint, C2 concept is technologically enabled by ABMS.  
However, this technical vision is in direct tension with the DAF's *cultural and doctrinal* reality. Air Force Doctrine Publication (AFDP) 3-99 reinforces the traditional, hierarchical C2 structure: "Airmen work for Airmen and the senior Airman works for the JFC". This creates a central doctrinal crisis, one articulated in the DAF's own internal inquiry: "Will machine-speed kill webs require centralization or decentralization of C2?".  
This is the central challenge for ABMS and JADC2. The DAF is accelerating the *technology* of decentralized C2 while its *command culture* remains centralized. Without a parallel acceleration of doctrinal reform and cultural adaptation—specifically, a new framework for "delegation of authority to AI systems" —the DAF will field a powerful but "glass house" C2 system. This system will be technologically capable of "machine-speed" C2 but will be operationally hamstrung by a human command structure unable or unwilling to use it at the required tempo, leading to mission failure.

### **2.2 Affordable Mass & Autonomy: The Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) Ecosystem**

The DAF's primary effort to acquire intelligent autonomous platforms is the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. The CONOPS for the CCA is to create a "family-of-systems" where AI-driven, semi-autonomous "loyal wingman" aircraft are "teamed" with crewed platforms, primarily the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter and the F-35.  
In this HMT construct, AI serves as the *pilot* for the CCA. The onboard AI will be responsible for executing complex tasks with "minimal human input" , including advanced surveillance, formation flying, electronic warfare, and direct combat engagement. The strategic goal is to generate "affordable mass". With a projected fleet of at least 200 NGADs and up to 2,000 CCAs , the DAF aims to supplement its small, expensive, crewed fleet with large numbers of "lower cost complimentary uncrewed systems" that can perform high-risk missions and overwhelm adversary defenses.  
While the technology is revolutionary, the *acquisition strategy* for the CCA program is equally, if not more, transformative. Learning directly from the failures of past "waterfall" hardware-centric programs , the DAF is *explicitly* "running separate acquisition pathways for the hardware and software elements". This hybrid model treats the CCA airframe (the "body") and the autonomy/AI software (the "brain") as two distinct, separately-sourced, and independently-upgradable products. The airframe is being developed via a rapid prototyping pathway (akin to MTA), while the AI "brain" is being developed via a rapid, iterative software pathway (akin to SWP).  
This "dual-path" strategy is enabled by a non-negotiable technical requirement for a government-owned, open, and common architecture. The DAF and U.S. Navy are collaborating to standardize four key components: common aircraft architecture, communications links, autonomy architecture, and ground-control segments. This mandatory open architecture is designed to prevent vendor lock-in, ensure interoperability between services and allies, and allow for the rapid, continuous updating of the AI software independent of the airframe.  
The CCA program, therefore, represents the DAF's first large-scale test of a new, hybrid acquisition model. Its success or failure will not only determine the future of U.S. air combat mass but will also serve as the validating test case for the entire acquisition reform enterprise. The successful execution of this model *must* become the template for all future intelligent platform acquisitions.

## **Part III: Systemic Barriers to Acceleration**

### **3.1 The Acquisition Barrier: Terraforming the "Valley of Death"**

The DAF's primary obstacle to fielding intelligent capabilities is not a failure of innovation but a failure of adoption. This failure is institutionalized in the "Valley of Death"—the well-documented funding, bureaucratic, and cultural chasm that separates a successful, innovative prototype (often from S\&T, R\&D, or a non-traditional startup) and its transition into a fielded, resourced Program of Record (POR).  
The root causes of this barrier are systemic:

* **Process Misalignment:** The DoD's legacy acquisition system was created for large hardware systems, not "data-intensive startups" or iterative software development. This creates a "glaring weakness" where promising software prototypes die while waiting for a hardware-based process to catch up.  
* **Funding Gaps:** The "valley" is a literal gap in funding streams. It is the period where non-recurring R\&D funding (e.g., from an SBIR or DIU prototype contract) ends, *before* recurring procurement or sustainment revenue (from a POR) begins.  
* **Bureaucratic and Cultural Risk Aversion:** The acquisition culture prioritizes "compliance" over "speed and execution". This risk-averse culture views the "Valley of Death" not as a problem to be solved, but as a necessary, multi-year "evaluation phase" or "capability development planning" process. While diligence is necessary, this protracted evaluation period is untenable in the face of adversaries who leverage "military-civil fusion" to move from concept to capability in a fraction of the time.

The DAF has attempted to build "bridges" over this valley with new organizations like the Integrated Capabilities Command, which correctly focuses on "mission threads" rather than platforms. However, these efforts have not yet been formalized or integrated into a "repeatable, transparent process". Until this "valley is terraformed," the DAF's innovation ecosystem will remain divided, and its ability to outpace its adversaries will be fatally undermined.

### **3.2 The Human Enterprise Barrier: Culture and Workforce**

The most significant and persistent barriers to accelerating intelligent capabilities are not technical; they are human. The DAF faces a two-front challenge in its human enterprise: a cultural resistance to autonomy and an institutional gap in digital-native talent.  
**Cultural Resistance:** There is a "persistent institutional resistance to disruptive change" within the Pentagon's bureaucratic structure. This resistance manifests in several ways:

* **Lack of Understanding:** The primary barrier is not fear, but a simple "lack of understanding" by personnel of what AI is and "how the technology can work for them". AI is often "made out to be some 'monolithic unicorn'" rather than "just another tool" , hindering its practical adoption for everyday tasks.  
* **Erosion of Trust and Identity:** The introduction of AI and autonomy threatens to "upend the culture of the U.S. military". Traditional values associated with "valor," "heroism," and the human-in-the-loop are challenged by technologies that "distance humans... from the battlefield". Building trust in an HMT relationship is a complex socio-technical problem, not just a technical one.  
* **Risk of Mis-Calibration:** This lack of understanding creates a dual-risk of *trust mis-calibration*. On one hand, a "healthy degree of skepticism" is warranted. On the other, the DAF faces the risk of "over-eager adoption". This can result in operators using brittle AI systems they do not fully understand, leading to mission failure or "inadvertent escalation". A concrete example occurred during an ABMS experiment, where an AI generated a Course of Action (COA) in 10 seconds (vs. 16 minutes for a human) but proposed using infrared-guided weapons in cloudy weather—a "non-viable COA" that, if acted upon, would have failed the mission and destroyed operator trust.

**Workforce & Talent Gap:** The DAF is in a "war for talent" but lacks the 21st-century human resource systems to win it.

* **Talent Tracking Failure:** The DAF "does not have a comprehensive system to manage talent and track skills across the force". Efforts to create dedicated AI or digital career fields have been "uneven" and, in some cases, "stalled".  
* **The "Trilingual" Leadership Gap:** The most acute gap is in leadership. To "honcho" AI adoption, the DAF needs "trilingual" leaders—senior personnel fluent in *technology* (AI/ML), *operations* (the warfighter's mission), and *acquisition* (the bureaucracy). The DAF's traditional career paths and professional military education (PME) systems are not designed to produce or promote this type of cross-functional expert.

This human-enterprise barrier is inextricably linked to the acquisition barrier. The "Valley of Death" persists precisely *because* the DAF lacks the "trilingual" acquisition professionals to manage it. The service's PEOs and PMs are, by and large, experts in traditional hardware programs. They are not the digital-native leaders required to "honcho" the rapid, iterative "evaluation phase" of a software-intensive prototype. To "terraform the valley" , the DAF must first cultivate the expert acquisition corps that knows *how* to use modern pathways (MTA, SWP) to bridge it.

### **3.3 The Technical Foundation Barrier: Data and Trust**

The final set of systemic barriers are the core technical prerequisites for any AI capability: a ready supply of "AI-Ready data" and a verifiable foundation for "trust."  
**Data Readiness:** This is the single greatest *technical* blocker to fielding AI at scale. AI systems "are beholden to logical principles". Their performance is entirely dependent on the quality, volume, and accessibility of the data used to train and operate them. The DAF's current data enterprise is not postured for this reality. To create an "AI-Ready force," the acquisition community *must* fundamentally reform its policies and "implement new data acquisition, intellectual property (IP), and contract management policies". This includes negotiating for the delivery of and rights to "AI-Ready data" in all new contracts. Without an enterprise-wide, governed, and accessible data framework , all DAF AI models will be brittle, biased, and unreliable.  
The "non-viable COA" from the ABMS experiment—suggesting IR weapons in cloudy weather —was not simply an "AI hallucination." It was a *data-starvation* problem. The AI model gave a bad answer because it was not fused with the necessary all-domain data (i.e., real-time weather) that the JADC2/ABMS data enterprise is *supposed* to provide. This proves that DAF intelligent capabilities cannot be developed in isolation. Their "intelligence" and trustworthiness are *directly and wholly dependent* on the success of the JADC2/ABMS data enterprise.  
**Trust and Validation:** This data-readiness problem flows directly into the socio-technical barrier of trust.

* **AI is Brittle:** AI models, especially those operating in a complex, dynamic battlespace, have significant problems with accuracy, bias, and brittleness.  
* **Trust Must Be Built:** Trust is not a given; it must be earned and maintained. This requires "good and frequent communication" from the AI system to the human operator , transparency about system flaws, and a formal process for "documenting AI system flaws and user mistakes" akin to mishap reporting.  
* **RAI as the Mechanism for Trust:** The DAF's mechanism for building this trust is the DoD's Responsible AI (RAI) framework. This is not an "add-on." It is the central prerequisite for fielding any AI capability that interacts with a human, especially in a high-stakes, "delegation of authority" scenario.

This "trust barrier" is, at its core, a *Command Responsibility* barrier. A commander cannot ethically or legally delegate authority for a high-consequence decision (e.g., weapons release) to an autonomous system without a verifiable, traceable, and understandable process. The "Traceable" and "Governable" tenets of RAI are, therefore, the central *legal and doctrinal prerequisites* for enabling the entire HMT and autonomous C2 CONOPS envisioned by ABMS and CCA. A failure to invest in the technical means of trust—such as Explainable AI (XAI) —is a failure of the entire intelligent capability concept.

## **Part IV: The 5-Year Acceleration Plan: Mandating a New Acquisition Operating System (AOS)**

The DAF's systemic barriers cannot be overcome with incremental, ad-hoc reforms. Acceleration requires a new, enterprise-wide "Acquisition Operating System" (AOS) that mandates the "best-of-breed" reforms—proven in pockets of excellence—as the new, non-negotiable standard for all intelligent capability programs. This AOS is built on four interdependent pillars.

### **4.1 Pillar 1: Institutionalize Rapid, Tailored Acquisition Pathways**

The first pillar replaces the DAF's default, hardware-centric acquisition model with pathways tailored for speed and software.

* **Mandate:** The Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) and the Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) must be moved from *exception* to the *default rule* for all DAF intelligent capabilities.  
* **Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP):** As mandated by DoD memorandum, the SWP is the preferred pathway for software. It must be used for the "brains" of DAF systems—this includes ABMS C2 applications, ISR data fusion algorithms, and the CCA autonomy software. The SWP bypasses the traditional JCIDS process, instead using an expedited Capability Needs Statement (CNS). Its goal is the rapid, iterative delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in under one year.  
* **Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA):** The MTA pathway must be the default for the "bodies" and hardware components of intelligent systems. This includes rapid prototyping of CCA airframes, new sensor pods, and edge-compute hardware. The MTA pathway is designed to deliver fieldable prototypes to the warfighter in 2-5 years.  
* **Contracting Vehicles:** To support these pathways, the DAF must mandate the *default* use of flexible, rapid contracting vehicles. This includes Other Transaction (OT) agreements and Commercial Solutions Openings (CSOs). These tools are essential for lowering the barrier to entry for the non-traditional "data-intensive startups" that hold the key to AI innovation.

This hybrid AOS model is not theoretical; it has been validated by several DAF pathfinder programs:

* **Case Study: Kessel Run (SWP):** Kessel Run proved that the SWP/Agile model can successfully modernize highly complex, "big-A" Acquisition programs. By pairing agile software development with user-centered design , Kessel Run rapidly delivers and iterates operational C2 software, most notably the C2IMERA (Command & Control Incident Management & Emergency Response Application), which was used to support the Afghan evacuation in real-time.  
* **Case Study: 'Angry Kitten' (MTA):** The Angry Kitten Combat Pod program proved the MTA pathway can rapidly field a complex electronic warfare (EW) capability. Its success was *explicitly* enabled by its "open hardware/software architectures" , which allowed for rapid, app-based reprogramming between flights to counter new threats—a feat impossible with legacy, single-purpose hardware.  
* **Case Study: Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) (OTA/Commercial):** DIU has repeatedly proven that OTs can successfully bridge the "Valley of Death" and transition commercial technology into production contracts. The Thunderforge project, which prototypes an AI-driven, theater-level C2 planning tool for INDOPACOM, is a perfect example of using this model to acquire and field mission-critical AI.

This new AOS, which synthesizes these successful models, is summarized in Table 1\.  
**Table 1: The New Acquisition Operating System (AOS) Model**

| Characteristic | Legacy Acquisition (Industrial Age) | New Acquisition Operating System (AOS) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Model** | Major Capability Acquisition (MCA) | Hybrid: **MTA** for Hardware \+ **SWP** for Software |
| **Requirements** | JCIDS (Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System) | Capability Needs Statement (CNS) ; Iterative user feedback |
| **Development** | "Waterfall" / Single, long-duration spiral | Agile, Iterative Sprints (measured in weeks) |
| **Delivery** | Monolithic; 5-10+ years (Program of Record) | MVP/MVCR in \<1 year (SWP) ; Fieldable Prototype in 2-5 years (MTA) |
| **Testing** | Separate, late-stage OT\&E phase | Continuous, automated testing integrated into development (DevSecOps) |
| **Security** | "Bolted-on" RMF/ATO (Authority to Operate) process | "Built-in" DevSecOps; Continuous ATO (cATO) |
| **Architecture** | Closed, proprietary, vendor-locked | **Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)** |
| **Primary Metric** | Cost/Schedule/Performance (KPPs) adherence | Lead Time; Cycle Time; Warfighter Adoption Rate |

### **4.2 Pillar 2: Mandate an Open, Agile, & Secure Technical Baseline**

The second pillar provides the *technical and process rules* that make the acquisition pathways of Pillar 1 functional. This AOS is an *interdependent stack*: the SWP (contracting) *requires* Agile (management), which *requires* DevSecOps (engineering), which *requires* MOSA (architecture).

* **Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA):** The DAF must mandate MOSA for *all* new intelligent systems. This is not optional; it is a *legal requirement* under Title 10 U.S.C. 4401(b). MOSA is a technical and business strategy that uses modular designs and open, consensus-based standards for key interfaces. This is the *foundational technical principle* that *unlocks* both the SWP (by abstracting software from proprietary hardware) and the MTA (by allowing rapid, competitive, component-level prototyping). The successes of Angry Kitten (open software/hardware architecture ) and the CCA program (common autonomy architecture ) are built on MOSA. This *must* be enforced via contract language to break vendor lock and enable incremental, rapid upgrades.  
* **Agile Methodology:** The DAF must mandate Agile development practices as the *management* framework for its software-intensive programs. Agile moves away from rigid, pre-defined requirements and instead "values working software over comprehensive documentation". It relies on iterative lifecycles ("sprints"), active user involvement, and a rapid response to change. This is the only management methodology that supports the SWP's goal of delivering an MVP in under a year.  
* **DevSecOps:** The DAF must mandate DevSecOps as the *engineering engine* for executing the SWP. DevSecOps is a culture and a set of practices that integrates development, security, and operations. It emphasizes "shifting left" to build security in from "day one" , using automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for testing and deployment. This "software factory" model, pioneered by Kessel Run and Platform One , enables the continuous, rapid, and secure delivery of code to the warfighter. This model must also be adapted to the unique needs of AI, incorporating MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) to manage the data and model workflows specific to AI.

### **4.3 Pillar 3: Forge the "Trilingual" Digital-Native Workforce**

The third pillar provides the *human capital* to execute the new AOS. The DAF cannot "buy" its way to AI dominance; it must *build* the expert workforce to "honcho" AI adoption. This requires a radical overhaul of DAF talent management, moving from an industrial-age model to one that can win the "war for talent".

* **Recruit (Force Renewal):** The DAF must aggressively scale its use of *existing* but under-utilized recruitment tools. This includes expanding the use of specialized **Direct Hiring Authorities (DHAs)** for C\&IT, STEM, and Acquisition series, which bypass slow, traditional processes. It must also leverage innovative platforms like **GigEagle** , which mines the Guard and Reserve for "dual-use" talent—for example, a Reservist Major who is a civilian Principal Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services.  
* **Develop (Force Development):** The DAF must build its "trilingual" (ops/tech/acq) leaders. \* *Embed:* Mandate the Kessel Run model enterprise-wide by **"embedding AI engineers in operational and support units"**. This co-locates the problem-solvers (engineers) with the problem-owners (operators) to rapidly identify needs and iterate solutions.  
  * *Educate:* Integrate AI and digital fluency (based on AFDN 25-1 and the JADC2 concept) into *all* Professional Military Education (PME).  
  * *Incubate:* Use elite programs like the **DAF-MIT AI Accelerator** and its "Phantom Fellowship" as incubators for high-potential "trilingual" leaders, then "champion cross-functional development" by placing them in key PEO and operational leadership roles.  
* **Retain (Force Management):** The DAF must stop training digital experts for its competitors.  
  * *Compensate:* Mandate the use of *existing* pay flexibilities to "close pay and income gaps". This includes the \*\*Cyber Excepted Service (CES)\*\*, which allows for qualification-based promotions and **Targeted Local Market Supplements** to pay a competitive wage for critical cyber and data-science roles.  
  * *Promote:* Fully implement the C\&IT Talent Management Framework's vision for dedicated career tracks that value technical expertise as highly as traditional command tracks, otherwise, the DAF will continue to lose its most-skilled digital talent.

Table 2 operationalizes this pillar into an actionable 5-year plan.  
**Table 2: 5-Year Digital Workforce Development Plan**

| Line of Effort | Year 1-2: Foundation | Year 3-4: Scale | Year 5+: Sustain |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

### **4.4 Pillar 4: Build Warfighter Trust via Enterprise-Wide Responsible AI (RAI)**

The fourth pillar provides the foundation of *trust* that makes the entire human-machine enterprise possible. Without trust, operators will not use the tools, and commanders will not delegate authority.

* **Mandate:** All DAF AI capabilities *must* be developed and deployed in accordance with the DoD AI Ethical Principles (Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable, Governable). This is the non-negotiable "trust layer" of the AOS.  
* **Integrate into Acquisition:** RAI is not a separate step; it is a continuous thread. The RAI Strategy and Implementation Pathway *must* be integrated into the *entire* acquisition lifecycle. The DIU's *Responsible AI Guidelines* provide a ready-made, proven process for integrating these principles into rapid, OTA-based prototyping efforts and must be adopted as a DAF-wide standard.  
* **Invest in T\&E and XAI:** Building "Warfighter Trust" requires rigorous, verifiable proof of reliability.  
  * *Test & Evaluation (T\&E):* The DAF must fund and operationalize robust T\&E for AI, specifically designed to identify and mitigate bias, failure modes, and "non-viable COAs".  
  * *Explainable AI (XAI):* The DAF must fund and require XAI, which provides methods for humans to "comprehend its overall decision and reasoning". This is the *technical* solution to the *command responsibility* barrier, providing the auditable "traceability" a commander needs to trust and delegate authority to a system.  
* **Governance:** The DAF must appoint RAI Officers within PEOs and Software Factories. These officers will be responsible for "documenting AI system flaws and user mistakes," creating a formal feedback loop for continuous improvement, much like the existing aviation mishap reporting process.

## **Part V: The 5-7 Year Technical Strategy: The Resilient Digital Backbone**

The 4-Pillar AOS provides the *process* for acquiring intelligent capabilities. The 5-7 year technical strategy provides the *foundational infrastructure*—the compute, communications, and trust layers—required for these capabilities to function in a contested operational environment. These three technologies are not independent; they form a single, integrated "JADC2 Digital Backbone" required to enable trusted, distributed AI.

### **5.1 Future Compute: From Centralized Cloud to the Tactical Edge**

**Challenge:** AI-driven operations, as envisioned by ABMS and the CCA program, cannot rely on a "reach-back" connection to a CONUS-based enterprise cloud in a comms-denied, contested environment. Real-time analysis *must* happen at the tactical edge.  
**7-Year Strategy (Hybrid Compute Architecture):**

* **Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2):** Scale DAF Enterprise Cloud (e.g., Cloud One) as the primary environment for **AI model training**, large-scale data analytics, and enterprise business functions (e.g., predictive maintenance data , enterprise logistics ).  
* **Phase 2: Integration (Years 3-4):** Develop and field "Intermediary Edge" capabilities at forward bases (e.g., in the INDOPACOM AOR). These nodes will serve as bridges between the enterprise cloud and the tactical network, allowing for forward-staging of data and AI models.  
* **Phase 3: Scale (Years 5-7):** Field ruggedized, low-SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) **AI inference hardware** on tactical platforms. This includes CCAs, NGAD, and mobile C2 nodes. This "at-the-edge" compute allows the AI "brain" (which was *trained* in the enterprise cloud) to *execute* (run inference) with "minimal intervention" , even when completely disconnected from the primary network.

### **5.2 Future Communications: Resilient Networking with 5G and O-RAN**

**Challenge:** The DAF's intelligent "internet of things" (ABMS) and its distributed swarms of CCAs require a high-bandwidth, low-latency, resilient, and secure "connective tissue". This data-heavy mesh network is the "make or break" factor for AI adoption at the edge , and legacy tactical data links are insufficient for the task.  
**7-Year Strategy (5G as the JADC2 Backbone):**

* **Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2):** Expand 5G testbeds at DAF bases, moving beyond basic connectivity to mature *use cases* for smart logistics, AR/VR maintenance and training, and base security.  
* **Phase 2: Integration (Years 3-4):** Mandate **Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN)** as the DAF standard for 5G implementation. O-RAN is the *MOSA equivalent for 5G*. It uses open, interoperable standards that prevent vendor lock-in with any single, proprietary supplier and is the key to ensuring interoperability with allies.  
* **Phase 3: Scale (Years 5-7):** Field private, secure, O-RAN-based 5G networks as the tactical "WiFi in the sky". This creates the high-throughput data mesh required for JADC2, linking dismounted Airmen, CCAs, C2 nodes, and sensors into a single, resilient, intelligent network.

### **5.3 Future Trust: Blockchain for Supply Chain and Data Integrity**

**Challenge:** The DAF's adoption of the AOS (Pillar 1 & 2\) creates two new, critical, and interdependent vulnerabilities:

1. **Supply Chain Integrity:** In a globalized, software-driven ecosystem, how does the DAF verify that a microchip in a CCA or a software update pushed from a DevSecOps pipeline is genuine and has not been compromised by an adversary?  
2. **Data Integrity:** In a contested C2 environment, how does a commander trust that the data they are receiving (e.t., a targeting coordinate from an autonomous sensor) has not been intercepted and spoofed?

**7-Year Strategy (Blockchain as the "Trust Layer"):** This strategy uses blockchain technology—a collaborative, tamper-resistant, and cryptographically-secure distributed ledger —to provide a verifiable "trust layer" for both the physical/digital supply chain and operational data.

* **Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2):** Fund Proofs-of-Concept (PoCs) for logistics and sustainment. Use blockchain to track high-value, critical components (e.g., F-35 parts) through the supply chain, similar to the NIST aviation supply chain PoC , to build a more resilient sustainment model for contested environments.  
* **Phase 2: Integration (Years 3-4):** This is the most critical, near-term application. Integrate blockchain technology into the DAF's primary DevSecOps pipelines (Platform One, Kessel Run). Use it to create an *immutable Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)*. Every code check-in, third-party library, security scan, and build is cryptographically hashed to the chain. This creates a verifiable, end-to-end "digital twin" for the software, proving its *provenance* and integrity in line with NIST Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) guidelines.  
* **Phase 3: Scale (Years 5-7):** Field blockchain-enabled C2 systems. In this model, critical data (e.g., target validation, sensor ID, delegation of command authority) is "on-chain." This provides the commander with a tamper-proof, auditable, and resilient record , technically fulfilling the "Traceable" tenet of Responsible AI.

This integrated 7-year roadmap, which forms the "JADC2 Digital Backbone," is summarized in Table 3\.  
**Table 3: 7-Year Future Technology Integration Roadmap**

| Technology | Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2) | Phase 2: Integration (Years 3-4) | Phase 3: Scale (Years 5-7) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Compute (Edge)** | **Crawl:** Scale Enterprise Cloud for AI model training. (e.g., PANDA predictive maintenance models ). | **Walk:** Field "Intermediary Edge" nodes w/ INDOPACOM. Test edge-inference on DIU/AFWERX prototypes (e.g., Thunderforge ). | **Run:** Field hardened, low-SWaP AI-inference modules on *all* new platforms (CCA, NGAD, ABMS nodes) for disconnected ops. |
| **Comms (5G)** | **Crawl:** Expand 5G testbeds at DAF bases for logistics/training. Select O-RAN as the DAF standard to ensure MOSA. | **Walk:** Prototype private, secure 5G tactical networks. Demonstrate 5G-enabled JADC2 "sensor-to-shooter" kill chains. | **Run:** 5G/O-RAN is the *primary data link* for the ABMS "internet of things" and for tactical C2 of CCA swarms. |
| **Blockchain (Trust)** | **Crawl:** Launch logistics/sustainment PoCs to track high-value parts in a contested environment. | **Walk:** Integrate blockchain into Platform One/Kessel Run DevSecOps pipelines to create secure, immutable SBOMs. | **Run:** Field blockchain-secured software supply chain for all operational AI (CCA/NGAD). Field blockchain-validated data for high-stakes C2. |

## **Part VI: Implementation, Metrics, and Strategic Recommendations**

### **6.1 Implementation Plan and Governance**

The 4-Pillar AOS and the 7-Year Technical Strategy will be implemented via a "Centralize Strategy, Decentralize Execution" governance model.

* **Centralize Strategy:** The DAF Chief Data and Artificial Intelligence Office (DAF CDAO) , in partnership with the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (SAF/AQ), will be the central authority responsible for setting and enforcing the *enterprise standards* for the AOS. This includes:  
  * Defining the MOSA standards and common architectures.  
  * Publishing the DAF-wide RAI implementation plan.  
  * Owning enterprise data governance policies.  
  * Defining and tracking the new success metrics (see 6.2).  
* **Decentralize Execution:** The Program Executive Offices (PEOs) (e.g., PEO Digital) and their empowered Program Managers (PMs) will be responsible for *executing* programs *within* this standardized AOS. Software Factories (Kessel Run, BESPIN, etc.) will be chartered as enterprise centers of excellence, providing DevSecOps platforms, tools, and expertise as a service to PEOs to accelerate execution. This model gives PMs maximum agility while ensuring enterprise-wide interoperability, security, and trust.

### **6.2 A New Lexicon for Success: Mandating Value-Based Metrics**

The single greatest reinforcement mechanism for the DAF's risk-averse, slow-moving culture is its legacy metrics system. A PM's career is judged by adherence to 5-year cost, schedule, and Key Performance Parameter (KPP) baselines. Under this industrial-age paradigm, an agile, iterative program that "responds rapidly to changes" and "delivers... incremental capabilities" *looks like* a failure ("requirements creep," "schedule slip").  
To change the *culture* (Pillar 3), the DAF *must* first change the *incentive structure*. This plan mandates the adoption of a new metrics dashboard focused on *speed, value, and agility*. Success is no longer "meeting the 5-year plan." Success is "delivering working software" that operators *actually adopt* and *use* to enhance the mission.  
Key metrics to be mandated include:

* **Lead Time:** The time from a warfighter's validated capability *request* to the *delivery* of a usable capability. This measures the *entire* acquisition pipeline, from idea to warfighter.  
* **Cycle Time:** The time from "work started" (e.g., code committed) to "work delivered" (e.g., code deployed). This measures the *efficiency* of the DevSecOps pipeline.  
* **Warfighter Adoption Rate / User Feedback:** A primary measure of *value*. Are operators (the *users*) adopting the tool, or is it "shelf-ware"? This counters the "Sunday-Monday divide" by forcing programs to build intuitive, mission-enhancing tools.  
* **Time to Reprogram / Update:** Based on the "Angry Kitten" lesson , how quickly can the program deploy a software update to a *fielded* system to counter a new, emergent threat? This is the primary measure of *agility*.

Table 4 formalizes this new incentive structure.  
**Table 4: Measuring Acceleration: A New Metrics Dashboard**

| Metric Category | Legacy Metric (Industrial Age) | New AOS Metric (Information Age) | What It Measures |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Speed** | % Schedule Met (vs. 5-yr plan) | **Lead Time** **Cycle Time** | Time-to-Value (Idea-to-Warfighter) Pipeline Efficiency (Code-to-Warfighter) |
| **Quality/Performance** | KPP/KSA Adherence | **Warfighter Adoption Rate** **Release Frequency** | Mission-Impact & User-Defined Value Responsiveness to Change |
| **Agility** | Requirements Stability | **Time to Reprogram / Update** (vs. new threat) | Ability to adapt at the speed of relevance |
| **Cost** | Program Cost Variance (vs. baseline) | **Cost per Value Point Delivered** | Efficiency of value creation |
| **Risk** | Risk-Avoidance (Program Stability) | **Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)** **Warfighter Trust Score** | Resiliency & Trustworthiness |

### **6.3 Summary of Strategic Recommendations**

This plan provides a comprehensive strategy to accelerate the acquisition of intelligent capabilities. Its success hinges on the DAF's willingness to move from *incremental reform* to *systemic change*. The following five recommendations are the critical, actionable first steps:

1. **Mandate the 4-Pillar AOS:** The DAF Secretary, via formal instruction, must mandate that all new intelligent capability programs use the integrated 4-Pillar Acquisition Operating System (MTA+SWP, MOSA+DevSecOps, Digital Talent, RAI) as the *default acquisition model*, effective immediately.  
2. **Appoint "Trilingual" Program Managers:** SAF/AQ and Air Force Personnel Command must immediately prioritize the identification, development (via the DAF-MIT AIA ), and assignment of "trilingual" leaders to manage the DAF's most critical intelligent programs (CCA, ABMS, NGAD).  
3. **Fund the Digital Backbone:** The DAF must prioritize and protect funding for the 7-Year Technical Strategy (Edge, 5G/O-RAN, Blockchain), recognizing it not as a "science project" but as the *foundational, enabling infrastructure* for all Seven Operational Imperatives.  
4. **Adopt New Metrics Immediately:** SAF/AQ and the DAF CDAO must adopt and track the "New AOS Metrics" (Table 4\) for all SWP/MTA programs. Programmatic success and failure, and by extension PM career progression, must be tied to these new value-based metrics.  
5. **Launch Blockchain-for-C-SCRM Task Force:** Charter a joint DAF CDAO / AFRL / PEO Digital task force to execute the "Blockchain for Software Supply Chain" strategy. This task force will be responsible for prototyping and integrating an immutable SBOM capability within Platform One and Kessel Run, with a goal of fielding a pilot capability within 24 months.
